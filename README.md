# SF Apartments

A tiny shared apartment-hunting tracker for me and a friend. Static site hosted on GitHub Pages. No backend, no database — apartment data lives in `data/apartments.json` in this repo and is read/written via the GitHub API.

## How it works

- HTML/CSS/JS, no build step.
- Each user enters a GitHub Personal Access Token in Settings; the app uses it to read and write `data/apartments.json`.
- Changes show up as normal commits on the `main` branch.

## One-time setup

### 1. Push this repo to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
gh repo create apartment-search --private --source=. --push
```

(Or use the web UI — public or private both work.)

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

In the repo on github.com:

1. **Settings → Pages**
2. **Source**: Deploy from a branch
3. **Branch**: `main`, folder `/ (root)`
4. Save. After a minute, the site is live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/apartment-search/`.

### 3. Add your friend as a collaborator

**Settings → Collaborators → Add people.** They need write access so their token can update the JSON file.

### 4. Each person creates a Personal Access Token

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta
2. **Generate new token** (fine-grained)
3. **Repository access**: Only select repositories → choose `apartment-search`
4. **Permissions → Repository → Contents**: Read and write
5. Copy the token (starts with `github_pat_...`).

### 5. Open the site and click Settings

Enter your name, the repo (`owner/apartment-search`), and your token. Done.

## Notes

- Tokens are stored in `localStorage` in your browser only. They never leave your machine except as GitHub API auth headers.
- If two people edit at exactly the same time, the second save will get a conflict — just hit Refresh and re-save.
- All edits show up as commits, so git history is your audit log.

## Importing from Craigslist

There's a script that pulls SF apartments from Craigslist's public API and merges them into `data/apartments.json`.

```bash
# Default: latest SF apartments, up to 50, all prices/sizes
node scripts/import-craigslist.mjs

# Common filters
node scripts/import-craigslist.mjs --max-price=4000 --min-beds=1 --max-beds=2 --limit=30

# Free-text query
node scripts/import-craigslist.mjs --query="hardwood floors"

# Preview without writing
node scripts/import-craigslist.mjs --max-price=4500 --dry-run
```

Duplicates are skipped by URL. After running:

```bash
git add data/apartments.json && git commit -m "Import Craigslist listings" && git push
```

Then click **Refresh** in the web app.

The script uses Craigslist's JSON API — no auth, no rate limit issues at normal use, no Browserbase needed.

## Automatic hourly sync (GitHub Action)

`.github/workflows/sync-listings.yml` runs every hour and, for each enabled source
(Craigslist and Redfin):

1. **Adds** new listings matching `data/search-criteria.json`.
2. **Marks listings off-market** — it re-checks every listing from that source and, if the
   posting has been taken down, flips its `status` to `off_market` (keeping the prior status
   in `prev_status`). Nothing is ever deleted from the file.

It then commits the updated `data/apartments.json` back to `main`, so the live site picks it up.

**Change the search criteria** by editing `data/search-criteria.json`:

```json
{
  "sources": ["craigslist", "redfin"],
  "price_by_beds": {
    "2": 4500,
    "3": 7000,
    "4": 8500
  },
  "min_price": null,
  "query": null,
  "neighborhoods": null,
  "bbox": { "min_lat": 37.70, "max_lat": 37.84, "min_lon": -122.52, "max_lon": -122.35 },
  "limit": 200
}
```

`sources` selects which sites to pull from (omit it to use all). Restrict a single run with
`node scripts/sync-listings.mjs --sources=redfin`.

`price_by_beds` is a **per-bedroom price ceiling** — in the example above, 2BR ≤ $4,500,
3BR ≤ $7,000, 4BR ≤ $8,500. The bedroom range and the overall price ceiling for the search
are derived from these keys, so only listings whose bedroom count appears here (and whose
price is within that tier) are added. Listings with no price or an unrecognized bedroom count
are skipped.

`bbox` is a **geographic gate**. Craigslist tags lots of out-of-city posts (Fremont, Oakland,
etc.) as San Francisco; the box keeps only listings whose coordinates fall inside SF, which is
far more reliable than filtering on title text. Remove the `bbox` key to disable it.

### Sources

Each source is a small adapter module registered in `scripts/sources.mjs`:

- `scripts/craigslist.mjs` — Craigslist's public JSON API. One listing = one posting.
- `scripts/redfin.mjs` — Redfin's public JSON "stingray" rentals API, which (unlike most
  commercial rental sites) serves cleanly to datacenter IPs, so it works from GitHub Actions.
  One listing = one **building**, which can span a bedroom/price range — `bedrooms`/`price`
  reflect the building's cheapest unit, the bedroom range is noted in the listing's notes, and a
  building is kept if its range overlaps your `price_by_beds` and its cheapest unit is within the
  cap. You'll occasionally see a studio price on a card whose building also has larger units —
  click through to Redfin for the full unit mix. The off-market sweep doesn't probe each listing
  page (those are bot-walled); instead it fetches the full live SF rental set from the same API
  once and marks a listing gone when its id drops out. The SF region is pinned in the adapter
  (`REGION_ID`/`MARKET`).

To add another source, write an adapter exposing `fetchListings`, `toApartment`, `isMine`, and
(optionally) `isListingGone`, then register it in `scripts/sources.mjs`. Prefer sites with an
open JSON API that isn't behind a bot wall (like Craigslist and Redfin). HTML-scrape sources get
blocked from CI's datacenter IPs — we previously shipped a Zumper adapter and it silently returned
**0 results from GitHub Actions** (it only worked when run locally), so we dropped it for Redfin.

**Requirements / notes:**

- Scheduled workflows only run from the **default branch**, so this file must be on `main`.
- In the repo: **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → Read and write permissions**
  (the workflow also declares `permissions: contents: write`).
- Trigger a run manually anytime from the **Actions** tab (**Run workflow**).
- Run the same logic locally:
  ```bash
  node scripts/sync-listings.mjs --dry-run   # preview, write nothing
  node scripts/sync-listings.mjs             # add new + off-market sweep
  ```

## Adding friends, gyms, and other places

The map shows additional points of interest from `data/places.json`. Add anything you want — friends, gyms, coffee shops, anything. Schema:

```json
{
  "category": "friends" | "gym" | "restaurant" | "coffee" | "grocery" | "park" | "transit" | "<your own>",
  "name": "Display name on the map",
  "address": "Street address",
  "type": "Optional: short type label (e.g. 'Bouldering + top rope')",
  "vibe": "Optional: longer description / vibe notes",
  "lat": 37.xxxx,
  "lon": -122.xxxx
}
```

Built-in categories have preset colors. `lat` / `lon` are optional — if missing, the app auto-geocodes the address via Nominatim on load (rate-limited to 1 req/sec). For best UX (instant render, no extra network call), prefer baking in the coords. Easiest way to get them:

```bash
curl -s "https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=$(echo '959 Jackson St, San Francisco, CA' | sed 's/ /+/g')&format=json&limit=1" -H "User-Agent: my-app" | jq '.[0] | {lat, lon}'
```

After editing, commit and push — every collaborator will see the change.

## Local development

Just open `index.html` in a browser, or:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```
